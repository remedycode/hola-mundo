Hey friends, Happy New Year! I'm adopting the philosophy of not setting resolutions for 2022 but instead establishing new routines. One of those routines I hope to adopt is acknowledging that I have a github profile. Lol, wish me luck! Looking forward to practicing a lot, working on some cool projects, and hopefully collaborating with you this year! Excelsior!
